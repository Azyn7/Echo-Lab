      <!---------------------------- FIRST TEXT BOX (INTRO) ---------------------------->
      <div class="text-box fade-in-out" id="introduction">
        <h3 style="position: relative; top: 10px;">Welcome to Whiterun!</h3>
        <article id="intro-article">
          <p id="intro-text">Your adventure has just begun. After escaping Helgan with your head,
            meandering around Riverwood, exploring the mountain to its north, and the
            accompanying crypts, you've finally found your way to Whiterun, as 
            was instructed by the man who helped you escape.<br><br>

            The town is full of people talking and going about their daily lives in
            the land of Skyrim within the province of Tamriel. Merchants, travelers, tourists,
            locals, and the like all co-exist within the city limits. <br><br>

            As you attempt to walk past the front gate into the main city, a man stops you.
            On his head is a uniquely shaped helmet and a well-defined tunic on his torso.
            In his left hand a shield, again with a unique logo: the very same logo 
            which adorned the tapestries lining the city walls. He was a guard. <br><br>

            Before saying a word, you both exchange a glance. He looks you up and down,
            and you do the same. You are unsure of why he approached, but it was clear
            he approached with purpose. 
          </p>

      <!---------------------------- GUARD IMG & NAME ENTRY ---------------------------->
      <div class="img-box text-box fade-in-out" id="guard">

      </div>

      <div class="text-box fade-in-out" id="dialogue">
        <p id="dialogue-text">
          Finally, after a moments hesitation, the guard speaks: <br>
          <br>
          "Halt. You, there, what purpose enter into the town ye? Carrying around such a 
          large blade, and this red substance? Is that blood? For what purpose? 
          You have no venison, nor pelts, from what I can make. What be your name?" <br>
          <br>
          As the man finished up his examination, he pulls from his cloak a book. The
          contents of the book are unknown to you. So, unsure of what to do, you decide
          it is best to comply, offering up your name:
